SVM can be used for both regression and classification problems.But above explained problem is Classifer Problem.

In SVM we want a classifier , so that it maximize the seperation between observation points and decision surface.
Distance of closest point to decision surface is called Margin.

So our main aim is to find the seperating surface which has highest margin width.
